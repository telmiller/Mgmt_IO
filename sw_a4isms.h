* Returned objects should be rejected
* if no priority or value information is
* included, however because customers don't
* tell you everything in the first meetings,
* objects may otherwise be incomplete.
* Objects may contain surprising data
* about customer context so your parser
* should be open and flexible. Function
* calls to this module should not contain
* an argument.  But, if you're not satisfied,
* it's appropriate to send multiple

* Data you send to this function will be formatted
* to fit inside a story telling framework.
* Standalone data that doesn't fit into
* this framework will be saved to /dev/null.
* However, the beauty of most marketing frameworks
* is that they are easily extensible.
* If you find important data is getting dropped,
* you can contribute a model-view-controller
* to enable the marketing framework to extend
* their UI.

* Sessions should be initiated through the
* Account Executive proxy, which establishes
* the connection but from then on, that session
* should be point-to-point. The protocol handler
* should accept all kinds of data, but pay
* attention to inbound vs outbound bit rates.
* If the ratio of outbound vs inbound data
* exceeds 3:4 or goes below 1:4, something
* is going wrong
